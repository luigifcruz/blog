I'm currently focusing my free-time developing Open-Source software. The following are my main projects:

- [CyberRadio](https://github.com/luigifreitas/CyberRadio): An SDR based FM/AM radio for desktop accelerated with CUDA.
- [PiSDR Image](https://github.com/luigifreitas/pisdr-image): The SDR Linux Distro for the Raspberry Pi.
- [WeatherDump](https://github.com/luigifreitas/weatherdump): Multi-platform toolkit for weather satellite reception.[^1]
- [Kimera](https://github.com/luigifcruz/kimera): Low-latency hardware accelerated codec based video streaming utility.

[^1]: Development paused at this moment.
