This new standard was released by the Khronos Group in 2016. When compared to OpenGL, Vulkan gives the developer more control over the hardware. This approach is widely used by other standards like DirectX 12 and Metal.
The Raspberry Pi Foundation is working with the Open-Source consultancy company called Igalia to develop Vulkan drivers for the Raspberry Pi 4 Broadcom SoC.</description></item></channel></rss>
